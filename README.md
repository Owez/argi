# argi

Argument parsing for the future ðŸš€

## Features

- Intuative macro approach
- Speedy compile times
- Zero dependencies, tiny binary bloat
- Rich auto-help generation with modern styling

## Quickstart

First, add this to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
argi = "0.1.0-beta.5"
```

And then you can create a simple application:

```rust
// TODO
```

When ran, you should see the following help message:

```none
TODO
```

You can find this and many more demo projects inside of the useful [`examples/`](https://github.com/Owez/argi/tree/master/examples) directory!
